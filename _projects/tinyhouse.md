Tinyhouse is a full featured web app that lets users book listings for residential properties. Furthermore, users may create listings if their accounted is connected to stripe through their profile settings **(Note: Many of the listings are auto generated and can’t actually be booked. In other words, only listings created by actual user accounts can be booked. Additionally, you can’t book a booking you yourself created).** Tinyhouse has many features, we’ll highlight some of my favorite ones.

### Smart Search

The smart search feature lets users enter any information related to an address(ex: street, city, or zip code). The search then will suggest(autocomplete) a list of possible matches based on its database so that the user may an available listing related to the search.
